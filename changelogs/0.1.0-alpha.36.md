# Release 0.1.0-alpha.36

## Features

- **Mermaid Caching**: Implemented a disk-based caching mechanism for Mermaid diagrams. Rendered SVGs are now stored in the `$APPDATA/mermaid_cache` directory and reused on subsequent renders to improve performance and reduces CPU usage.
- **Improved Caching UI**: Added `data-cache-path` attribute to the Mermaid DOM elements for better observability and debugging of the caching status.

## Fixes

- **Tauri Permissions**: Corrected file system permissions in `capabilities/default.json` for the mermaid cache directory (using the correct `$APPDATA` variable).
- **Mermaid UI Stability**: Fixed a race condition and state synchronization issue in the Mermaid component to ensure cached content is displayed immediately when available.
