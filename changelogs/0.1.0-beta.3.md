# 0.1.0-beta.3

## Fixes

- **MCP Client**: Fixed an issue where Node.js-based MCP servers using `npx` failed to start in production builds. This was caused by symlink detection issues within the macOS application sandbox. The fix ensures that symlinked binaries are correctly identified and used by the MCP client.
