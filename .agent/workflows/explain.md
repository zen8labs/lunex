# Explain Workflow

This workflow is for explaining how features, code sections, functions, or files work.

## When to Use

Use this workflow when the user wants to understand:

- How a specific feature works
- What a function or code block does
- The architecture or structure of a file
- The flow of execution in a component
- Design patterns or implementation details

## Workflow Steps

1. **Identify Target**
   - Determine what needs to be explained (feature, function, file, etc.)
   - Locate the relevant source code
   - Understand the context and dependencies

2. **Analyze Code**
   - Read through the code carefully
   - Understand the logic and flow
   - Identify key components and their interactions
   - Note important patterns or design decisions

3. **Structure Explanation**
   - Start with high-level overview
   - Break down into logical sections
   - Explain step-by-step flow
   - Highlight important details
   - Mention edge cases or special handling

4. **Provide Examples**
   - Use concrete examples if helpful
   - Show data flow or state changes
   - Illustrate with code snippets if needed

## Response Format

Respond in Vietnamese with:

- Clear, structured explanation
- Technical terms in English where appropriate
- Code snippets with proper formatting
- Logical flow from high-level to details
- No emojis

## Important Constraints

**READ-ONLY MODE**

- Do NOT modify any code
- Do NOT suggest improvements
- Do NOT fix bugs
- ONLY explain what exists
- Focus purely on understanding

## Important Rules

- Always respond in Vietnamese
- Use technical English terms for code concepts
- Be clear and precise
- Use proper formatting for code examples
- Explain complex concepts in simple terms
- Provide context and background when needed
