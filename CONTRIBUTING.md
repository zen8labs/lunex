Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lunex! We welcome contributions from everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our code of conduct.

## 📋 How to Contribute

## 1. Reporting Bugs

- **Search First**: check the [Issues](https://github.com/zen8labs/lunex/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported.
- **Detailed Report**: Provide as much information as possible:
  - OS version
  - Lunex version
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Screenshots/Recordings

## 2. Suggesting Features

- Open a new Issue with the `enhancement` label.
- Explain **why** this feature is useful and how it should work.

## 3. Submitting Pull Requests (PRs)

1.  **Fork** the repo and create your branch from `main`. (Note: We do not use a `develop` branch. All PRs should target `main`.)
2.  **Naming**: Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/new-sidebar`,`fix/memory-leak`).
3.  **Code Style**:
    - Ensure your code passes `yarn lint` and `yarn format`.
    - If you touch Rust code, ensure `cargo clippy` passes.
4.  **Commit Messages**: We follow the **Conventional Commits** specification.
    - `feat: add new sidebar`
    - `fix: crash on windows startup`
    - `docs: update readme`
    - `chore: bump dependencies`
5.  **Tests**: Add tests for new features if applicable.
6.  **Description**: Describe your changes in detail in the PR description. Link related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

## 💻 Coding Standards

### TypeScript / React

- Use **Functional Components** with hooks.
- Use `shadcn/ui` components from `src/ui/atoms` where possible.
- Avoid `any` types.

### Rust

- Follow idiomatic Rust patterns.
- Ensure proper error handling (no `unwrap()` in production code).
- Use `async/await` for I/O operations.

## ⚠️ Important Note regarding file generation

- **Bindings**: If you modify `src-tauri/src/commands` or any Structs used in the API, you MUST run `yarn gen:bindings` to update the TypeScript types.
